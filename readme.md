Delete files🗃 in one go with same extension/filetype. Node version

  

Have you encounterd a situation where you have to select multiple files📁 with same filetype/extension to delete them, I have

when deleting multiple .srt files from my directory.

  

##  ‍Prerequisites

```

node js

```

##  🔮Usage

  

```

npm install -g batch-deletion-node-version

```

```

batch-delete --filetype --path

```

  

There are two arguments you have to pass.

  

It is ❗important❗ to specify the file type or extension.

```

--filetype or -ft

```

  

It is optional to specify the path, by default it will take current working directory.

```

--path or -p

```

##  🪜Example

```

batch-delete --filetype txt

```

***or***

```

batch-delete -ft txt

```

  

##  ✖️Multiple file type arguments

You can pass multiple filetypes at sametime

```

batch-delete --filetype txt java cpp

```

## 🚶‍♀️Walk through subdirectories.

Suppose you want to delete `file.txt` from each directory inside the current directory.
you have to pass flag -sd or --subdir as true. By default the flag is false so it wont delete files from sub-directories.

```bash
Current Directory
 └─> test
     ├── file.txt
     └─> first folder
         ├── file.txt
         └─> second folder
             ├── file.txt
             └── test.java
```
```
C:\Current Directory> batch-delete -ft md -sd true
```
*This will delete all file's with extension as .md from given directory📂 and it's subdirectories🗃.*
